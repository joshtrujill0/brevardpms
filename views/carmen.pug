                    p.agent-bio I was born and raised in Brevard County. I have served my community as a realtor for over 20 years. I not only serve Brevard County, but many other surrounding counties as well. Some of my greatest qualities are great communication, effective negotiating skills, dedication, integrity and adapting to each and every client's real estate needs. My number one goal for my entire career has been and will always be 100% customer satisfaction and happiness. I look forward to working with you!
